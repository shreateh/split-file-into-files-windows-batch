**Background:**
When working with large text files, it's often necessary to split them into smaller chunks for easier handling or processing. This is especially useful for log files, data exports, or any other text-based data that needs to be segmented.

**Step 1: Setting Up the Environment:**
Create a new folder where you want to store your batch script and the files you'll be working with.

**Step 2: Writing the Batch Script:**
Download FileSplitter.bat and place the batch script in the same folder as the file you want to split. Double-click on the batch script to execute it. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of lines to start splitting.

**Step 3: Understanding the Output:**
Run FileSplitter.bat. It will prompt you to insert a number. This number represents the total number of new files to be split each time.

**Step 4: Understanding the Output:**
The script will create multiple output files in the same directory, each containing a portion of the original file based on the specified line count. Empty lines will be preserved in the output files.


**Important Considerations:**
- Backup your files: It's highly recommended to create a backup copy of your files before running the script in case of any unexpected issues.
- Test carefully: If you're unsure about the script's behavior or the potential impact on your files, run it on a test set of files first to verify the results.
